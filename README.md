# E-Commerce-Shipping-Pipelines-Project-

### In this project I wanted to get myself into a real company case, analyzing the logistics part of a business and getting conclusions around customer satisfaction.
### For it, I have taken a dataset from Kaggles called "E-Commerce Shipping Data", which gave me the logistics data of an international e-commerce company that sells electronic devices.
### Then, once the dataset was analyzed, the dataset has been enriched with an API called "Order-Tracking" which gives me all delivery options I have around the world.
